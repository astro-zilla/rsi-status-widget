# rsi-status-widget
## Description
A widget to display the RSI (Roberts Space Industries) server status as a widget on your home screen using ther Scriptable app. Scrapes the webpage and displays the current status and the time at which it was last scraped.

## Instructions
Download rsi-status.scriptable and open it in the scriptable app. If this doesn't work, import rsi-status.js as a new script.

Currently only laid out for a medium widget, although modifying for other sizes should be simple. Feel free to pull request with any improvements.
